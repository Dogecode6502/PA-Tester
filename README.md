# PA-Tester
Tester program for testing your Python programming assignments more easily


### Testing your program

NOTE: This tester was designed for Python programs which consist of functions to be called; programs which require a user input or other methods, as well as programs written in other programming languages, may not work or will require modifications to be made to this program for it to work as expected.

1. Copy the program into the .py file you want to test. I would advise leaving it at the end of the program so that you can easily remove it when you are finished.
2. Add example tests from the instructions as well as any test cases you create into the "tests" list of the program. Don't forget to include a comma after each function call, or you will get a syntax error.
3. Add the expected outputs of your tests into the "output" list. These MUST be in the same order as the function calls from the "tests" list or the tester will generate incorrect results. Again, don't forget to add a comma after every item in the list or the program will generate an error.
4. Add global variables which are required for the functions to run (if any) under the comment "Example variables".
5. Test away. Make sure to remove this tester program as well as any other extraneous code you added for testing purposes from your program when you are ready to submit it.
